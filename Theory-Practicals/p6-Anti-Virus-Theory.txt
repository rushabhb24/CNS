**Theory**   
  
Introduction: 
The uses of computer are increased 
day by day. A computer people can share information from one computer to another computer 
with the help of device or media. In the current days there are various ways or method for 
sharing information because people can carry several gigabytes or terabyte of data from one 
destination to another destination. We also know history and which devices are used to 
exchange information in the world. There are several ways a user can go about copying data 
from one computer to another computer. In the process of exchanging the information using 
communication media there will be a problem of attack of malware or computer virus. A 
computer virus is a computer program that can spread across computers and networks by 
making copies of itself, usually without the user's knowledge. Viruses are capable of displaying 
different messages, denying all kinds of access, data thefts, changes in valuable data or files, 
deleting systems or any files, or it disable hardware. 

** Working of Anti-virus **:
Antivirus software works by comparing your computer applications and files to a database of 
known malware kinds. Because hackers are continually creating and disseminating new 
viruses, it will also check systems for the presence of new or undiscovered malware threats. 
The antivirus checks files, programs. and applications going in apd out of your computer to its 
database to identify matches. Similar and identical matches to the database are segregated, 
scanned. and eliminated.   
Most programs will employ three types of detection devices:   
• Specific detection. which looks for known parts or types of malware or patterns that are       
linked by a common codebase   
• Generic detection is a type of detection that looks for known parts or types of malware or 
patterns that are related to a common codebase.   
• Heuristic detection is a type of virus detection that looks for unknown infections by    
spotting suspicious file structures.  

** Need of Anti-virus **:   
• Antivirus plays an important role in any device. Following are a few of the top protection 
provided by it.   
• Antivirus detects malware and viruses that prominently penetrate company systems.
This 
will help in maintaining the hygiene of the computer.   
• The growth of hackers is immense these days. Hackers tend to target sensitive and 
confidential data from your system. In the presence of antivirus. the activity of data access and 
more can be detected. Moreover, the data will be protected to a great extent by the antivirus 
software.   
• If you regularly plug in external devices to your PC, the antivirus software will protect your 
PC/laptop from any potential virus from any external device.   
• Through the above-mentioned methods, your PC/ laptop will be protected against viruses 
to a great extent. As a result, your computer will have a long life.   
  
Virus Protection:   
The main role of an antivirus program is to face viruses and other sorts of malware. The viruses 
won’t only cause damages to your data, it can degrade the general system performance. All of 
them can happen without your knowledge. The antivirus programming introduced on your PC 
distinguishes and eliminates this malware before they create any damages to your PC.   
  
Spyware Protection:   
Spyware because the name suggests may be quite a malware that spies on your computer 
stealing all the confidential information. These details also inelude MasterCard details. 
passwords. and other financial data. This ultimately results in fraud. The antivirus software has 
the potential to stop these sorts of spyware attacks.   
  
Web Protection:   
While surfing the web, users can encounter various other sorts of threats. In untrustworthy sites. 
cyber attackers can gather your MasterCard and checking account details. One among the 
thanks for overcoming this is often by using antivirus software. Using an antivirus program, 
you'll protect your valuable pieces of information while surfing online.   
Spam Protection:   
Viruses also can enter your computer through means of spam emails and ads. These emails and 
ads can show up repeatedly albeit you haven't any interest in it. Once the virus finds thanks to 
sneak into your PC it causes irreversible damages. An Antivirus works by the way of blocking 
these spam emails and ads.   
  
Firewall Feature:   
The firewall provides two-way protection. This suggests that regardless of the information 
that's sent or received is going to be double-checked here. Hence, hackers cannot enter the 
system data.   
  
Cost-Effective:   
Even though there are many premium versions of antivirus programs for a monthly/yearly 
subscription fee, there are some antivirus programs that are completely free from charge. These 
sorts of antivirus programs offer almost an equivalent level of protection provided by the 
subscription-based. Albeit you select to afford a premium version, they're relatively 
inexpensive.   

** Drawbacks of Antivirus **:   
  
System Slowdown:   
Using an antivirus program means tons of resources from the memory and therefore the disk 
drive is getting used. As a result, it can drastically slow down the overall speed of the pc. 
Moreover, the method of scanning also can cause lags within the network.   
No Complete Protection:   
If you're employing a free antivirus program, there's no guarantee that it'll provide you the 
entire protection. Moreover, they're capable of identifying only certain sorts of threats. So as 
for acquiring a complete level of protection, you've got to use a firewall also.  
Security Holes:   
When security holes are present inside the OS or the networking software, it'll provide an 
opportunity for the virus to bypass the antivirus software. Unless the user takes action to stay 
updated. the antivirus software won't be effective.   
  
Limited Detection Techniques:   
For identifying a possible threat. there is always quite one method available. However. within 
the case of antivirus programs, it mostly executes the tactic of virus scanning. Sometimes the 
antivirus programs can offer you false alarms if the scanning matches with the traditional file.   
  
Frequent Advertisements:   
Apart from premium versions of antivirus programs, through some means, the free antivirus 
software must generate an income. Advertising is one of the ways to realize them. Many 
sometimes these advertisements degrade the user experience.    
  
No Customer Support:   
Unless you buy the premium version, there won't be any customer support given to you. Within 
the event of any problem, the sole thanks to overcoming are through forums and knowledge 
bases.
