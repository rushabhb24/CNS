This Python code implements a simplified version of a DES-like (Data Encryption Standard) encryption algorithm. It performs a series of transformations on a given plaintext input to produce ciphertext. The code includes several functions to handle string manipulation, key generation, and the encryption process itself. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Code Breakdown
Imports:

The random module is imported to generate random keys.
Helper Functions:

string_to_continuous_binary(s): This function takes a string s and converts each character to its binary representation, concatenating these binary strings into one continuous binary string. Each character is represented by 8 bits (1 byte).

random_key(n): This function generates a random key of length n bytes. It creates a string of random characters by generating random integers between 0 and 255 (the range of byte values) and converting them to characters.

xor_block(block, key): This function performs a bitwise XOR operation between corresponding characters of a block and a key. It uses the ord() function to get the ASCII values of the characters and then XORs them. The result is converted back to characters.

split_block(block): This function splits a given block of text into two halves. It calculates the midpoint of the block and returns the left and right halves.

Main Encryption Function:

des_like_encrypt(plain_text): This is the main function that implements the encryption process.
Padding: It first checks if the length of plain_text is a multiple of 8. If not, it pads the plaintext with spaces to make it 8 bytes long.
Block Splitting: The padded plaintext is split into 8-byte blocks.
Key Generation: It generates 15 random 4-byte keys for the first 15 rounds and a separate 8-byte key for the final round.
First Round: For each block, it splits it into left and right halves. It performs the first round by XORing the left half with the first round key and swapping the halves.
Subsequent Rounds: For rounds 2 to 15, it continues to XOR the left half with the respective round key and swaps the halves.
Final Round: In the 16th round, it shifts the left half left by 1 bit (using bitwise left shift) and XORs the shifted left half with the final round key.
The final ciphertext for each block is combined into a single string.
Main Function:

main(): This function serves as the entry point of the program.
It prompts the user to enter a plaintext message.
It calls the des_like_encrypt function to encrypt the plaintext.
It prints the ciphertext after the first round in binary format and the final ciphertext after the 16th round in regular string format.
Summary
The code simulates a simplified version of the DES encryption algorithm by processing the input plaintext in 8-byte blocks and applying a series of XOR operations with randomly generated keys over multiple rounds.
It demonstrates how to manipulate strings and perform basic encryption techniques in Python.
The output includes both the binary representation of the ciphertext after the first round and the final ciphertext after all rounds, showcasing the transformation of the original plaintext into encrypted text.
