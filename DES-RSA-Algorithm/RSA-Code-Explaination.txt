This Python code implements a simplified version of the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) cryptographic algorithm, which is widely used for secure data transmission. The code includes functions for generating RSA keys, encrypting messages, and decrypting them. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the code:

Code Breakdown
Imports:

The code does not use any external libraries, relying solely on Python's built-in functionalities.
Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):

gcd(a, b): This function computes the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b using the Euclidean algorithm. It repeatedly replaces a with b and b with a % b until b becomes zero. The last non-zero value of a is the GCD.
Modular Inverse:

mod_inverse(a, m): This function computes the modular inverse of a under modulo m. The modular inverse is a number x such that (a * x) % m = 1. The function uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find this inverse. If the result is negative, it adjusts it to be positive by adding m0.
Prime Check:

is_prime(n): This function checks if a number n is prime. It returns False for numbers less than or equal to 1. For numbers greater than 1, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of n. If n is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True.
RSA Key Generation:

rsa_generate_keys(p, q): This function generates the public and private keys for RSA encryption.
It first checks if the input numbers p and q are prime using the is_prime function.
It calculates n = p * q, which is used in both the public and private keys.
It calculates Euler's Totient Function φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1).
The function then selects a public exponent e such that (1 < e < φ(n)) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1. This ensures that e is coprime with φ(n).
It computes the private exponent d using the mod_inverse function, ensuring that ((e * d) % φ(n) = 1).
Finally, it returns the public key (e, n) and the private key (d, n).
Encryption:

encrypt(message, public_key): This function encrypts a numeric message using the RSA public key.
It extracts e and n from the public key and uses the formula: cipher = (message ** e) % n to encrypt the message.
It returns the encrypted message.
Decryption:

decrypt(encrypted_message, private_key): This function decrypts the encrypted message using the RSA private key.
It extracts d and n from the private key and uses the formula: decrypted = (cipher ** d) % n to decrypt the message.
It returns the decrypted message.
Main Function:

main(): This function serves as the entry point for the program.
It prompts the user to input two prime numbers p and q, and a numeric message to encrypt.
It generates the public and private keys by calling rsa_generate_keys(p, q).
It encrypts the message using the encrypt function and decrypts it using the decrypt function.
Finally, it prints the public key, private key, original message, encrypted message, and decrypted message.
Summary
The code provides a basic implementation of the RSA algorithm, demonstrating key generation, encryption, and decryption.
It emphasizes the importance of prime numbers in RSA and shows how to perform modular arithmetic to secure messages.
The program is a good educational tool for understanding the principles of RSA encryption and how public-key cryptography works.
