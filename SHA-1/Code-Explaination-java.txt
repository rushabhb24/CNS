This Java code snippet demonstrates how to compute the SHA-1 hash of a user-provided string using the MessageDigest class from the java.security package. Below is a detailed explanation of the code:

Code Breakdown
Imports:

import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;: This import is used to specify the character encoding (UTF-8) when converting strings to bytes.
import java.security.MessageDigest;: This import allows the use of the MessageDigest class, which provides the functionality to generate hash values.
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;: This import is used to handle exceptions that may occur if the specified hashing algorithm is not available.
import java.util.Scanner;: This import is used to read user input from the console.
Main Class and Method:

public class MessageDigestExample: This defines a public class named MessageDigestExample.
public static void main(String[] args): This is the main method where the program execution begins.
User Input:

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);: A Scanner object is created to read input from the console.
System.out.print("Enter the string: ");: This line prompts the user to enter a string.
String input = scanner.nextLine();: The user's input is read and stored in the variable input.
Hash Calculation:

try { ... } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) { ... } finally { ... }: This block is used to handle exceptions that may occur during the hash calculation.
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-1");: A MessageDigest instance is created for the SHA-1 hashing algorithm. If SHA-1 is not available, a NoSuchAlgorithmException will be thrown.
byte[] hash = md.digest(input.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));: The input string is converted to bytes using UTF-8 encoding, and the digest method is called to compute the hash. The result is stored in the hash byte array.
Hash Conversion to Hexadecimal:

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();: A StringBuilder is created to efficiently build the hexadecimal string representation of the hash.
for (byte b : hash) { sb.append(String.format("%02x", b)); }: This loop iterates over each byte in the hash array. The String.format("%02x", b) method converts each byte to a two-digit hexadecimal string, which is appended to the StringBuilder.
String output = sb.toString();: The final hexadecimal string representation of the hash is obtained by converting the StringBuilder to a string.
Output:

System.out.println("The SHA-1 hash of the input string is: " + output);: The computed SHA-1 hash is printed to the console.
Exception Handling:

If the SHA-1 algorithm is not available, the catch block will execute, printing an error message: System.out.println("Error: The SHA-1 algorithm is not available on this system.");.
Resource Management:

finally { scanner.close(); }: This ensures that the Scanner resource is closed, preventing resource leaks.
Summary
This Java program allows the user to input a string and computes its SHA-1 hash.
The program handles potential exceptions related to the availability of the SHA-1 algorithm and ensures proper resource management by closing the Scanner.
The output is presented in a hexadecimal format, which is a common representation for hash values.
